      <p> This specification is a companion guide to the <a
          href="https://w3c.github.io/webmediaapi/" target="_blank">Web
          Media API spec</a>. While the Web Media API spec is targeted
        at device implementations to support media web apps in 2017,
        this specification will outline best practices and developer
        guidance for implementing web media apps. This specification
        should be updated at least annually to keep pace with the
        evolving Web platform. The target devices will include any
        device that runs a modern HTML user agent, including
        televisions, game machines, set-top boxes, mobile devices and
        personal computers. </p>
      <p> The goal of this Web Media API Community Group specification
        is to transition to the W3C Recommendation Track for standards
        development. </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <ol class="ednote" title="Notes on v1 draft specification:">
        <li>This document is directed towards application developers.
          Its content will contain best practices for building media
          applications across devices, it will not direction to device
          manufactures or User Agent implementers. </li>
        <li>This is a companion spec put forth by the Web Media API
          Community Group.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>The scope of this document includes general guidelines, best
        practices, and examples for building media applications across
        web browsers and devices. </p>
      <p>The target audience for these guidelines are software
        developers and engineers focused on building cross-platform,
        cross-device, HTML5-based applications that contain
        media-specific use cases.</p>
      <p>The focus of this document is on HTML5-based applications,
        however the use cases and principles described in the guidelines
        can be applied to native applications (applications that has
        been developed for use on a particular platform or device). The
        examples in this document provides a starting point to build
        your media application and includes example implementations from
        various providers and vendors. This document also includes
        sample content and manifests as well as encoding guidelines to
        maximize the provide hints on achieving the best quality and
        efficiency for your media applications.</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>These guidelines will cover making your applications compliant
        with accessibility requirements from the perspective of
        delivering and consuming media. However, to make sure your
        entire application is accessibility-friendly, please see the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">W3C Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
      <h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
      <p>In order to provide a common language to build this document
        and communicate concepts to the end reader, we are providing a
        Glossary of Terms to this guideline document.<br>

                their content and that if those links are used
                elsewhere, the use will expire at the expiration time.</td>

      <h2>Media Playback Use Cases</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Streaming overview</h3>
        <p> NOTE: Adding a brief introductory section that removes the
          need for duplication of material across VOD and linear
          sections. Here we can outline the broad mechanics that are
          shared by the two use cases allowing us to focus on the
          distinctions in the respective sections. </p>
        <h4>General Description</h4>
        <p>Material (typically in video or audio content) is made
          available by a content provider via a web-enabled application
          and delivered by a content distribution network. There are
          three distinct interlocking processes: generation, delivery
          and consumption / playback. </p>
        <h4>Content Generation</h4>
        <p> Original Content is normally delivered to the service
          provider as a file with near lossless compression.
          Specifically, for High Definition content at 1080p with 50 or
          60 frames-per-second, the bitrate of the original content is
          typically 25Mbps to 150Mbps. </p>
        <p> Streaming content is generated by encoding the source
          against an encoding profile. Firstly, the content is
          duplicated into different versions of the file that target
          delivery over a connection that achieves a certain bandwidth,
          these are the different bitrates. After this is it split into
          segments of specified length. </p>
        <p> The first process is defined by an encoding profile. A
          profile describes the set of constraints to be used when video
          is being prepared for consumption by a range of video
          applications. The description includes the different bitrates
          to be generated during the encoding process that will allow
          for the same content to be consumed on a wide variety of
          devices on different networks from cellular to LAN. </p>
        <p> The second process is performed by a packager which segments
          the different bitrates. These are then packaged into a
          transport format such as transport streams (.ts) or fragmented
          mp4s (.m4s) after this they are encrypted with a DRM that is
          suitable for the environment where the content is going to be
          played out. The packager is also responsible for the
          generation of a manifest file, typically a DASH (.mpd), HLS
          (.m3u8) or possibly Smooth (.ism) or HDS (.f4v), that
          specifies the location of the media and its format. </p>
        <h4>Content Delivery</h4>
        <p> After the content has been generated the resulting segments
          of video and corresponding manifest files are pushed to an
          origin server. However, the assets are rarely delivered
          directly from the origin. </p>
        <p> At this stage, the control in the chain switches to the
          client's web video application. The content provider supply's
          the client with the URL of a manifest file located on a CDN
          rather than the origin. / The manifest is typically passed to
          a player. The player makes a GET request for the manifest from
          CDN edge, its location is determined by DNS. The CDN does one
          of two things: if it has the asset it returns it to the
          player, if it does not it requests it from the origin. When it
          receives it the CDN caches the manifest for use by other
          sessions and then then returns it to the requesting client. </p>
        <h4>Content Playback</h4>
        <p> The player parses the manifest. At this point the behavior
          differs between players found on the different devices
          depending on the transport formats. However, broadly, it
          behaves in the following way: <br>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The client uses DRM license URL to request a secure key to
            enable decoding of the media.</li>
          <li>The player's ABR (adaptive bitrate) algorithm determines
            the bandwidth available to the client by examining the
            response times associated with the request for the first
            segment of video, how many bytes were received over what
            time period. This provides enough information to determine
            the playback quality that the player can sustain over a
            proportion of the length of the asset, or in the case of
            live streaming a specific timeframe. </li>
          <li>Once the player has this information it can then compare
            this with the metadata from the manifest that describes the
            different qualities that the content provider is supplying.
            It picks the quality level with an average bitrate that is
            as close to the available bitrate but within its bounds to
            avoid a situation where a consistent experience is
            interrupted as the player requires more data than the
            current network bandwidth can supply, where the player’s
            buffer is emptying faster than it is being filled. </li>
          <li>It then requests a segment from a location on the edge
            server that typically relative to the location of the
            manifest. </li>
          <li>Once it has received the segment it is then typically
            decrypted in accordance with the specific DRM used. </li>
          <li>It then adds it to the player's video buffer. </li>
          <li>The media engine pulls the video data from the buffer and
            passes it to the video surface where it is rendered. </li>
          <li>If the available bandwidth remains constant the player
            will continue to request segments from the same bitrate
            stream, pulling down chunks and filling its video buffer. In
            the event a change in network availability the player will
            make a decision about the need to either drop to a lower
            bitrate stream or request a higher bitrate child manifest
            and associated segment. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>On-Demand Streaming (VOD)</h3>
        <p> Despite the almost identical mechanics used for the two
          types of content, VOD and linear, the contents generation,
          delivery and playout a large organsiation will typically
          maintain two distinct workflows as there are subtle but
          important ways in which they differ. </p>
        <h4>Content Generation</h4>
        <p> For VOD the source is typically tape rather than a feed. The
          encoding profiles are also subtly different. A greater
          priority can be placed on high quality as the latency, time to
          live, is not a requirement. To this end the encoder is able to
          prioritise density over quality via configuration allowing VOD
          encoders to spend more time on each frame. There are important
          differences in the manifests created. In HLS there is a tag
          that tells the player whether the playlist is describing on
          demand material: #EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD. As we will see
          shortly this is used by the player. There are also client side
          restrictions where certain profiles are blocked due to rights
          restrictions and network consumption capped bitrates on movies
          and entertainment whilst being allowed on sports content.
          Fragments size will also effect playout as a player's ABR can
          be more responsive if the chunks are smaller, e.g. 2 seconds
          rather than 10 seconds. </p>
        <h4>Content Delivery</h4>
        <p> The CDN configuration and topology for delivering VOD
          content is also different to linear. There are different
          levels of caching; popular VOD content which is kept closer to
          the edge in the CDN network in this way it can be delivered to
          customers faster than an edge server that isn't tuned for high
          volume delivery. Older and less popular content is retained in
          mid-tier caching whilst the long tail content is relegated to
          a lower tier. </p>
        <h4>Content Playback</h4>
        <p> As mentioned in the content generation section the player
          uses a tag within the manifest to determine the playout type.
          In HLS if there is a type is VOD then the player will not
          reload the manifest. This has important consequences if there
          are changes in availability after the session as commenced. In
          DASH the difference between a live and VOD playlist are more
          subtle (more detail) </p>
        <p> There are other differences in playout as well. Unlike
          linear, a VOD asset has a predefined duration, information
          around duration and current time can be used to update the UI
          to provide feedback to the user on the amount and proportion
          of the asset watched. </p>
        <p> At a broader level the UX requirements will be different in
          respect to the need for representing static rather than linear
          content where a tile view rather an epg (electronic programme
          guide) is required. There is also a requirement for Trick
          Play. </p>
        <h3>VOD use cases</h3>
        <p> In the previous section, we outlined the use cases
          associated with video streaming. In this section, we give some
          examples of use cases that are specific to on-demand streaming
          and are mainly related to strategies employed on the clients
          to improve performance in some way. </p>
        <h4> Pre-caching </h4>
        <p> The key performance indicator for most streaming services
          will be the percentage of sessions that experience buffering
          as a ratio to the length of the session. Buffering, the state
          of the video application when the player has insufficient
          content within its framebuffer to continuously play content,
          within a session has a direct relationship to engagement and
          as a consequence retention. For every second of buffering
          within a session 10pc of users abandon a video stream.
          Pre-caching is a strategy used in on-demand streaming. Web
          video application developers will use points within an
          application's UX to pre-cache content, for example when
          entering a mezzanine/synopsis page the application might
          connect to a stream and begin to pull content and either add
          it directly to the player’s video buffer or alternatively
          store the chunks locally. The consequence of this is that when
          or if the user chooses to play the content after reading the
          synopsis the video will commence playing without buffering and
          hence provide the user with a preferable experience to a
          buffering indicator. This technique is used by Netflix, Sky
          and the BBC in the case of on-demand content being watched in
          an in-home context. This technique is not used for cellular
          sessions where user’s mobile data would be consumed
          potentially on content that they do not watch. </p>
        <h4>Client-side ad insertion</h4>
        <p>Client-side ad insertion (CSAI). Typically, this involves
          using a script available in the client runtime, JavaScript in
          the case of the web, to insert an advert during the user’s
          session. As an example, an ad serving vendor provides a client
          script. Close to the player’s initiation the client library
          makes its api available. The web application listens to events
          associated with playback, for example the video elements media
          event ‘playing’. The web application then calls the DOM pause
          method on the video element and then calls the play method
          provided by the client-side ad library, passing it the ‘id’ of
          the video asset. This is then returned to the vendor, possibly
          along with other identifiers that can be used to target the
          audience with a specific ad. At this stage an auction is
          performed with business logic at the ad vendor determining
          which provider supplies the ad (this is a complex topic and
          outside the scope of this document). The vendor responds with
          a VAST (Video Ad Serving Template) payload that includes the
          URI of the ad content appropriate for the playback
          environment. In some cases, there is no ad, if this is the
          case the user is presented with the content they originally
          requested and control is passed back to the web video
          application. If there is an ad targeted against the content
          then the library performs DOM manipulation and injects a new
          video element into the document this is typically accompanied
          by a further script that provides the vendor with insights
          based on the current session. The ad plays. The ad object will
          conform to VPAID (Video Player Ad Serving Definition) and
          present a standardised interface to the player for possible
          interaction, it will issue a standard set of events which the
          web application can listen to. In response to an ‘adEnded’
          event the local library will tear down the injected DOM
          elements and in turn issue an event that the web application
          can use to trigger a return to playing the original content.
          In the case of live linear CSAI web socket technology is often
          used. If the content has a dynamic nature, for example a
          sports event or a fashion show, a web socket connection is
          established and ads can then be ‘pushed’ when the editorial
          team thinks it’s appropriate. The web video application
          listens to the library that establishes and manages the
          connection. An event is pushed to the listening clients
          simultaneously, this event is then used to trigger the same
          set of events discussed above. </p>

      <h2>Media Playback Methods</h2>
      <p>TBD </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Device Identification</h3>
        <p>Device identification is required both at the level of device
          type and family and also to uniquely identify a device.
          Different techniques are used in different environments.</p>
        <h4>Device Type</h4>
        <p>In the context of a mobile client the broad device type is
          already known - you can’t install an Android client on an iOS
          device. However, operating systems evolve and are extended.
          Within an the application layer you will still need to
          determine the level of support for feature X and branch your
          code accordingly. <br>
          If the application is hosted or the same application is
          deployed via different app stores then the clients runtime
          could be more ambiguous. The classic approach is to use the
          navigator.userAgent. Whilst this returns a string that does
          not explicitly state the device by name a regular expression
          match can be used to look for patterns that can confirm the
          device family. As an example the name ‘Tizen’ can be found in
          the user agent strings for Samsung and ‘netcast’ for LG
          devices. In the Chrome browser the strings will be different
          on windows, mac, android and webview.<br>
          Another method similar to feature detection is to look for
          available APIs, many of these are unique to a device, for
          example if(tizenGetUser){ then do X }.</p>
        <h4>Unique device Identifier</h4>
        <p>After you have determined what type of device you are on you
          need to be able to identify that device uniquely. Most device
          manufacturers provide an API so once you have discovered what
          type of device you are on you then know what API’s will be
          available to you. Each manufacturer provides a string
          constructed in a different way, some use the serial number of
          the device itself whilst others use lower level unique
          identifiers taken from the hardware. In each case the
          application layer should attempt to namespace this in some way
          to avoid an unlikely, but theoretically possible, clash with
          another user in any server-side database of users and devices.<br>
          In a classic pc /browser, rather that mobile or stb,
          environment there are technical issues with using unique
          identifiers as a user can access these stored locally and
          either delete them or reuse them in another context, this
          could allow them to watch content on more devices than their
          user account allows. For this reason some vendors prefer to
          use DRM solutions that both create and encrypt unique
          identifiers in a way that obscures them from the user.</p>

        <h3>Device Content Protection Capabilities</h3>
        <p>A web video application needs to determine the content
          protection capabilities of the device that is being used to
          playback the content. The method of doing this will vary from
          device to device and between DRM systems.<br>
          Like most DRM Widevine is only implemented on a subset of
          available devices. For native, non-browser, playout in iOS
          Google provide Widevine CDM which acts as a wrapper for
          AVPlayer or other third party players. Beyond short form DASH
          video being transcoded by a third party plugin such as Viblast
          this presupposes HLS content encrypted with widevine.<br>
          Android provides a DRM framework that provides an API:
          mDrmManager.getAvailableDrmEngines(), this returns an array of
          strings that represent the DRMs available on the android
          device. <br>
          Regardless of a device's capability to play back a stream
          encrypted with a specific DRM it is worth noting that a
          content provider will be aware of this capability in advance
          and consequently encrypt the streams to target a specific
          device. Beyond technical feasibility: can device X play back
          content encrypted with DRM Y? the provider will have a number
          of considerations when choosing a DRM for playback on a
          specific device; cost, utility, complexity and content value
          (the last consideration being mapped to contractual
          obligations). As a consequence, in most situations the API
          call that requests the stream from a back end service will
          either be to a service that is only configured to return
          streams with a suitable encryption or the server will use data
          from the request headers or key value pairs in the request
          payload to determine which streams to return. <br>
          In the context of the browser the major vendors broadly
          dictate the DRMs available, Apple’s Safari browser and Apple
          TV support Apple’s FairPlay DRM. Microsoft's Internet Explorer
          and Edge browsers only support Microsoft's PlayReady out of
          the box whilst Google’s Widevine Modular is supported by
          Google’s Chrome browser but is also included the browser
          developers not tied to a significant hardware providers; Opera
          and Firefox. Currently Microsoft’s PlayReady dominates the

          Browser DRM detection capabilities are tested via the EME
          (Encrypted Media Extensions) API. The API is an extension to
          the HTMLMediaElement. The process of determining the available
          system is broadly as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The stream is passed to the video or audio media element</li>
          <li>The browser detects the stream is encrypted</li>
          <li>The media event encrypted is thrown</li>
          <li>A check is made to see if there are already MediaKeys
            associated with the element</li>
          <li>If there are no keys already associated with the element
            then use the EME API navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess()
            to determine which DRM system is available. This is done by
            passing a key value pair that includes a string
            representation of each MediaKey system to the above method
            which in turn returns a boolean</li>
          <li>Use the MediaKeySystemAccess.createMediaKeys() to return a
            new MediaKeys object.</li>
          <li>Then use HTMLMediaElement.setMediaKeys(mediaKeys)</li>
        </ol>
        The remaining steps are covered in a later section on using EME
        but it’s worth noting at this stage that the
        navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess() is not uniformly
        implemented across all modern browsers that support EME. As an
        example Chrome returns true for ‘com.widevine.alpha’ however IE
        and Safari throw errors and Firefox returns null. A possible
        solution to this is offered <a

        and/or include the code example directly). </section>

      <h2>Content Encoding Guidelines</h2>
      <p>Preparing your content for encoding is one of the most
        important steps to ensure maximum quality and excellent viewer
        experience. In general, there are a few steps to get your
        content ready for web delivery.</p>
      <p>These steps include the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare encoding master</li>
        <li>Decide on rendition set</li>
        <li>Decide on delivery formats to support</li>
        <li>Encoder profile creation</li>
        <li>Encoding master files into specific rendition output format</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <p>The first step in preparing your master content is to render an
        encoding master file from your source (typically a non-linear
        editor or master magnetic or optical media).</p>
      <p>In order to maximize quality, a lossless codec is typically
        used for the encoding master, such as Apple ProRes, H.264
        Intra-frame, or Motion JPEG 2000. For detailed info on how to
        configure your encoding master, see the appropriate provider
        recommended settings documentation for your codec of choice.</p>
      <p>Typically encoding masters are rendered in the native
        resolution and framerate that the source was acquired. A common
        configuration using Apple ProRes would be as follows:</p>
      <p>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Codec</td>
              <td>Resolution</td>
              <td>Bitrate</td>
              <td>Framerates</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="4">Apple ProRes 422</td>
              <td>3840x2160</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h4>Rendition Bouquet</h4>
      <p>In most streaming use cases, adaptive streaming (ABR) is used.
        When ABR technologies such as HLS, DASH, or CMAF are used,
        typically a bouquet or rendition set are encoded to provide the
        best match of resolution and bitrate for the viewer’s device and
        connection.</p>
