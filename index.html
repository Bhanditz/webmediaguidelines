        This specification companion guide to the Web Media API spec. While the Web Media API spec is targeted at device implementations to support media web apps in 2017, this specification will outline best practices and developer guidance for implementing web media apps. This specification should be updated at least annually to keep pace with the evolving Web platform. The target devices will include any device that runs a modern HTML user agent, including televisions, game machines, set-top boxes, mobile devices and personal computers.
